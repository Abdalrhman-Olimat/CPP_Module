That’s great — you already understand OOP, canonical class structure, and operator overloading.
So the only real “mystery” for you is **fixed-point numbers**. Let’s clear that up step by step.

## 🔢 What is a Fixed-Point Number?

Think of it as **a way to represent fractional numbers using integers**.

* Normally, with `float` or `double`, the decimal part is handled by the hardware using IEEE floating-point representation.
* With **fixed-point**, you choose a fixed number of bits that represent the fractional part, and you store everything as an integer under the hood.

👉 It’s like pretending you always multiply every number by some constant, so you can keep it as an integer but still have fractions.

## ⚙️ Example with 8 fractional bits

In your project, the rule is:

* Use **8 bits for the fractional part**.
* So every number is stored as an `int`, but really it means:

$$
\text{real value} = \frac{\text{stored integer}}{2^8}
$$

* `2^8 = 256`.
  That means:
* The integer `256` in storage actually represents `1.0`.
* The integer `512` in storage actually represents `2.0`.
* The integer `128` in storage actually represents `0.5`.

## 🎯 Why use it?

* **Performance**: In older hardware (and some embedded systems), integer math is faster than floating-point.
* **Precision control**: You know exactly how many fractional bits you have.
* **Applications**: Graphics, audio, embedded systems, DSP.

## 🛠 How it works in your class

In your `Fixed` class:

* Private members:

  ```cpp
  int _value;                   // stores the scaled integer
  static const int _fracBits=8; // number of fractional bits
  ```

* If you want to **store a float**:

  ```cpp
  _value = roundf(f * (1 << _fracBits));
  ```

  Example: store `42.42`
  → `42.42 * 256 ≈ 10859` (that’s what gets stored as `_value`).

* If you want to **convert back to float**:

  ```cpp
  return (float)_value / (1 << _fracBits);
  ```

* If you want to **convert to int** (drop decimals):

  ```cpp
  return _value >> _fracBits;
  ```

## 🚀 Mini Demo

```cpp
Fixed a(10);       // stores 2560 internally (10 * 256)
Fixed b(42.42f);   // stores 10859 internally
std::cout << a;    // prints 10
std::cout << b;    // prints ~42.42
```

Internally:

* `a._value = 2560`
* `b._value = 10859`

But when you print, it divides by 256 to show the real number.

✅ So the key idea is: **Fixed-point = integer storage with an implied decimal point at a fixed place.**

Would you like me to draw you a **visual diagram** (like a number line showing how integers map to fixed-point with 8 fractional bits)?
